# Woodfiber_Project
Repository with data sheets, R-objects, and R-scripts needed to replicate analysis done in *Wood-fiber amendments shift soilless substrate microbiomes and suppress Pythium ultimum root rot in greenhouse-grown chrysanthemums* paper by Borrero et al. 

Both bacterial and fungal datasets and materials are present in this repository, denotated by "B" or "F" initials or full names i.e. "BacterialFullDatset". The r-markdown document "psF-and-psB-gensis" outlines how the DADA2 output was combined with metadata files to create the initial phyloseq objects.  MicrobiomeAnalysisScript.R is an annotated R-script that describes how each cleaned ps-object was made, what files are neccesary for their creation, and the subsequent beta and alpha diversity analysis published in the paper. The relationship between microbial diversity and disease severity was analyzed in the methods outlined in the Desease-Score.R script.
